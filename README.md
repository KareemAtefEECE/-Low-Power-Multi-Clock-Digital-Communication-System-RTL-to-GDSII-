This Repo includes the Full Digital Design and ASIC Implementation of the Low Power Multi Clock Digital Communication System as follows:

 • Designed and implemented a complete low-power multi-clock digital communication system with UART interface,
 ALU processing, and asynchronous FIFO for cross-clock domain data transfer
 • RTL Design of system blocks (ALU, Register File, Asynchronous FIFO, Integer Clock Divider, Clock Gating,
 (Data/Reset) Synchronizers, Main Controller, UART TX, UART RX) with integrated testbenches
 • Used SpyGlass for checking for any RTL Liniting or CDC potential problems
 • Complete ASIC Flow for the system on the SAED 90nm technology, starting from Synthesis and DFT using Design
 Compiler
 • Using ICC2 Library Manager for NDM Creation and ICC2 tool for the PNR flow: (Floor/Power) Plan, Placement,
 CTS, Routing, and Chip finishing
  • There is a Report attached includes all the deatils of the ASIC FLow on the System
