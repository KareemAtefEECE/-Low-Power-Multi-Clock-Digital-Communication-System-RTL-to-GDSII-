This Repo includes the Full Digital Design and ASIC Implementation of the Low Power Multi Clock Digital Communication System as follows:

 1) Designed and implemented a complete low-power multi-clock digital communication system with UART interface,
 ALU processing, and asynchronous FIFO for cross-clock domain data transfer

 2) RTL Design of system blocks (ALU, Register File, Asynchronous FIFO, Integer Clock Divider, Clock Gating,
 (Data/Reset) Synchronizers, Main Controller, UART TX, UART RX) with integrated testbenches

 3) Used SpyGlass for checking for any RTL Liniting or CDC potential problems

 4) Complete ASIC Flow for the system on the SAED 90nm technology, starting from Synthesis and DFT using Design
 Compiler

 5) Using ICC2 Library Manager for NDM Creation and ICC2 tool for the PNR flow: (Floor/Power) Plan, Placement,
 CTS, Routing, and Chip finishing

 6) There is a Report attached includes all the deatils of the ASIC FLow on the System
